## 🚫 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### **1. Proposal Mistakes**

❌ **Generic proposals:**
```
"Hi, I can do this project. Please check my profile."
```

✅ **Personalized proposals:**
```
"Hi [Name], I read your requirements for a restaurant website and I've built 10+ similar sites..."
```

---

### **2. Pricing Mistakes**

❌ **Too low:** $5/hour or $50 for a full website
- Attracts bad clients
- Unsustainable
- Devalues your work

✅ **Fair pricing:** $30/hour or $300-800 for websites
- Attracts serious clients
- Sustainable income
- Professional positioning

---

### **3. Scope Creep**

❌ **Saying yes to everything:**
```
Client: "Can you also add a blog, e-commerce, and 10 more pages?"
You: "Sure, no problem!" (without extra charge)
```

✅ **Setting boundaries:**
```
"I can definitely add those features! Since they're outside the original scope, the additional cost would be $X. Would you like me to prepare a detailed quote?"
```

---

### **4. Communication Mistakes**

❌ **Slow responses** (24+ hours)
❌ **Unclear updates** ("Working on it...")
❌ **No questions** (assuming you understand everything)

✅ **Best practices:**
✅ Respond within 1-3 hours
✅ Clear, detailed updates
✅ Ask clarifying questions upfront

---

### **5. Delivery Mistakes**

❌ **Poor delivery:**
- No documentation
- Messy files
- No instructions
- Bugs/errors

✅ **Professional delivery:**
- Clean, organized files
- README with instructions

- Tested and bug-free
- Bonus: Video walkthrough
