## 🔥 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem: Site shows 404 error**
**Solution:**
- Wait 2-5 minutes (GitHub Pages needs time)
- Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled (Settings → Pages)
- Check your URL is correct

### **Problem: Site has no styling (looks like plain text)**
**Solution:**
- The single file `index.html` has everything inside
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try in incognito/private mode
- Make sure you uploaded the COMPLETE file

### **Problem: Can't upload to GitHub**
**Solution:**
- Make sure you created a PUBLIC repository
- Make sure the file is named exactly `index.html`
- Try uploading in a different browser

### **Problem: Mobile menu doesn't work**
**Solution:**
- This is normal! It's a static demo
- The menu should still be visible and clickable

## 🎨 OPTIONAL: CUSTOMIZE LATER

```css
--primary-color: #6366f1;      /* Blue */

--accent-color: #ec4899;       /* Pink */
